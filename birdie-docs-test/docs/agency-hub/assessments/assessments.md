# Overview

A vital part of providing care to a client is understanding their needs, so these can be properly documented and addressed.


## Which assessments does Birdie offer? 
In the Care Plan, Birdie provides a 2 step approach:

1. A Needs Assessment to help structure and create the Care Plan, made up of questions covering:
    - Personal Care
    - Everyday Activities
    - Social Support
    - Environmental
    - Nutrition & Hydration
    - Medical
    - Administrative
    - Psychological


2. From here, further, more in-depth assessments can be completed:
    - Environment & Fire Risk
    - Mental Capacity
    - Waterlow
    - Moving & Handling
    - Communication
    - Financial

Information about each individual assessment can be found under `Details` on the menu on the left. 

With the green tick and information on "Last Updated", it's easy to see at a glance at the Care Plan dashboard which assessments have been completed, and when:

Lastly, you can also upload documents and other paper-based assessments as part of the Care Plan - this means all relevant information is stored in one place. 

## How do I use Birdie Assessments?
When you create a client on Birdie, you will be redirected to their `Basic Info` page. The next tab down, `Care Plan`, will show you all the details, assessments, and documents in one place - like a "Home Page" for the client. Simply click on an asssessment and off you go!

## I have more questions. Where should I look?
