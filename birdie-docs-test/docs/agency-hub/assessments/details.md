This section is quite big, so use this menu on the right to skip to the sub-section you're interested in.

Each sub-section shows the questions from that assessment. 

## **Needs Assessment**
The Birdie Needs Assessment (or Preliminary Assessment, or Risk Assessment, as some agencies call it) is the first stop in the Assessment journey. It allows care managers to sit down with a client and get to know them and their needs, preferences and desires across a **wide range of areas**.

From here, it's easy to spot further, more in-depth assessments which need to be undertaken. A Care Plan for the client can then be drawn up using these as a strong, well-documented base.

Here are the questions for each of the 8 areas of care. Please note, we have extensive and different answer options - these are just to outline which questions we answer. We are committed to gathering the most precise and helpful answers for care staff. If you're interested in the answer structure, please ask your account or sales executive to run you through the demo.
