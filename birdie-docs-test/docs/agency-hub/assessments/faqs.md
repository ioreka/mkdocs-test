# FAQs

## **How is an assessment linked to the Care Plan?**

Each of those first 8 areas under "Assess and Plan" has 4 quick sections:

1. Needs Assessment (an overview of the client's needs)
2. Assessment Summary and Outcomes (how your team can support the client, and any goals)
3. Tasks (to achieve these goals)
4. Risks & Mitigations (for your team to be aware of)

This provides an easy aand clear link from the assessment area to the wider Care Plan as a whole. In addition, many agencies provide care as part of reablement packages, supporting clients to regain pre-admission levels of independence and function. As part of this, reablement packages often require care agencies to have a section for Goals, Outcomes or Achievements. By using Birdie Assessments, Care Managers can include everything in one process, saving time and making required information transparent.

## **Can I see what the questions are? I need to know if Birdie Assessments covers our needs.**

Yes! We know this is a common concern for agencies who are looking to make the transition to paperless, and we want to make sure you're confident. All the information can be found under `Details` on the menu on the left hand side of this page. 

## **How do you build Birdie Assessments?**

It's an in-depth process with constant refinement. We want to make assesments which are:

1. Of industry-leading standards
2. Useful for *all* our agencies, even though every agency operates slightly differently

In order to do this, we:

- speak to as many Care Managers as possible about what their needs are for a particular assessment
- review clinical best practices, national guidelines, and evidence for this assessment
- consult with appropriate clinical practitioners in the field
- review and synthesise multiple (more than ten) different existing paper assessments to make sure we cover all bases required
- test it out multiple times to ensure it's as quick and easy as possible

We are committed to continuous improvement, and very open to hearing your thoughts on the assessments. It can be difficult to meet every single requirement sometimes as different agencies ask for almost contradictory things, but at the end of the day we are here to provide better, easier digital care, so we will absolutely try our hardest!

## **Can I make my own assessment, or customise them?**

At the moment, no. However, we work hard to make our current Assessments suite as flexible as possible. For example, there is space in a "free text box" under almost every question for Care Managers to add more information, and [something else here].

## **Do the assessments auto-save?**

They do auto-save as you complete them, so if you navigate away from that page for any reason, the assessment will be saved as "In Progress".  In general, Birdie has been built this way to try and support Care Managers as much as possible.

The only exception to this in Birdie is when you're creating a new client and adding the Medical History items - these won't be saved until you click "Create". 

## **Can I delete an assessment?**

No. The reason behind this is creating what's called a "version history" - quite literally, a visible history of all the versions of something. It's very common in technology and just the same as keeping all the old paper copies of your assessments for auditing purposes. The CQC commonly want to see a history of care plans, assessments or interventions as part of their Inspection Reports, so this is a really easy way of being able to show that evidence. 

Assessments are organised in Birdie with the most recent at the top. If you really want to delete one, for example if you were making a test or dummy assessment during training, you can reach out to your Account Manager who can do this for you.

## **Can I edit an assessment after I've submitted it?**

No - again, this is to do with creating that very clear audit trail, and help you show inspection bodies like the CQC that everything is easily visible. 

## **Why do I have to type everything out again when I'm making a new assessment and not many things have changed?**

At the moment, this is to ensure whoever is undertaking the assessment is prompted to review *all* questions, rather than just going through on auto-pilot and potentially missing something. After all, when completing a new assessment on paper, you must re-answer all the questions!  However, we are aware that some agencies are concerned about the amount of time this is taking, and we are considering whether Birdie should auto-fill answers based on the previous assessment. 

## **Birdie doesn't have an assessment I need. What should I do?**

We are working on more assessments this very moment, and will let our customers know when they are ready to launch. 

## **I'd like to suggest an improvement to an assessment. What should I do?**

We'd love to hear from you. Please let your Account Manager know your feedback via email, Intercom or phone and it will go straight to us!

## **Waterlow:**

- Why can't Birdie calculate a score for the Waterlow assessment?

The Birdie Waterlow is a direct translation of the original Waterlow Assessment. If any of the questions are changed or altered, it is no longer a clinically valid tool. With this in mind, we are also aware that Birdie is not yet classified as a Medical Device, so we actually aren't able to calculate the score for you just yet. For now, please continue to add up the scores yourself just as you would do with a paper-based Waterlow.

## **Medication:**

- I need to list all the medications, not just the ones my agency supports with. What should I do?

A very good question, and one we know is important because good medication management is critical. You are able to store this information in About Me/Medication Assessment.
